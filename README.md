# Improved Discord Theme(eventually s)

For [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp).

Discord's built-in theme, while isn't inherently *bad*, it has many flaws.

That's where Improved Discord Dark comes into play. It tries to fix the dark theme without changing the overall
concept or design.

In the dark theme, I made the following improvements:

* Increased the contrast of some of the really dim things such asâ€¦
 * The placeholder text on the chat box. Did Discord really expect people to be able to read that?
 * The dividers in the chat
 * Timestamps and the "(edited)" indicator
 * The channel list
 * Headings
 * Icons
 * The dark blue role
 * Links, though I don't really like how it looked on second thought
 * How many friends are online
* Got rid of the white dialogs
* Fix potential scroll lag
* More coming soon. Submit a bug report if you have a pet peeve you want me to fix.

Let me know when you find an issue by submitting a bug report. If you can get the name of the element which caused
the problem, great.

At the time of this writing, only the dark theme is available. And the download link isn't up yet, but this will
be updated when it is up.
